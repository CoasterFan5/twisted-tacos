# Welcome to my personal hell
This is a cooking game, with a **twist** made with Svelte.
It's also for [Madison Jam 2](https://itch.io/jam/madison-jam-2)

## Warning
This is a big repo because I put all the assets here. This is not a serious project but if you want to play it, a playable demo is coming soon.

## The big question?
Why not use godot?
I don't know. I should have.
