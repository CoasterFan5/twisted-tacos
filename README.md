# Welcome to my personal hell

This is a cooking game, with a **twist** made with Svelte.
It's also for [Madison Jam 2](https://itch.io/jam/madison-jam-2)

## To Do (48 hours left btw)
- Add the ingreadient wheel
- Add ingreadient groups on plates
- Customer ordering
- Serving orders

## Warning

This is a big repo because I put all the assets here. This is not a serious project but if you want to play it, head over to [tacos.coasterfan5.com](https://tacos.coasterfan5.com)

## The big question?

Why not use godot?
I don't know. I should have.
